## Technical Approach - Keep It Simple

### Minimal Stack
```
Backend:
- Python + FastAPI (simple, fast)
- PostgreSQL (user data)
- Redis (session cache)
- OpenAI API (recommendations)

Integrations:
- Meta Webhooks API (Instagram/Messenger)
- WhatsApp Business API

Deployment:
- Single Heroku dyno to start
- Upgrade as needed
```

### Core Data Model (Start Simple)
```python
User:
  - id
  - instagram_id
  - name
  - values: ["eco", "local"]
  - created_at

Conversation:
  - id
  - user_id
  - messages: JSON
  - created_at

Gift:
  - id
  - user_id
  - recipient_name
  - occasion
  - suggestions: JSON
  - selected: String
  - created_at
```

## User Testing Protocol

### Weekly User Interviews (5 users minimum)
1. **Onboarding:** How was your first experience?
2. **Quality:** Were the suggestions relevant?
3. **Speed:** Was it faster than your usual process?
4. **Trust:** Would you buy these gifts?
5. **Return:** Will you use it again?

### Key Metrics to Track
- Conversation completion rate
- Time to recommendation
- Suggestion acceptance rate
- Return user rate
- Platform preference

## Risk Mitigation - Start Small

| Risk | Simple Solution |
|------|-----------------|
| Complex AI responses | Use templated responses with AI fill-ins |
| Platform restrictions | Start with one platform, validate, then expand |
| Data privacy | Minimal data collection, clear consent |
| Scaling issues | Cap at 100 users initially |
| Poor recommendations | Human review queue for quality |

## Launch Strategy

### Week 1-4: Friends & Family Alpha
- 10-20 close users
- Daily feedback
- Rapid iteration

### Week 5-6: Private Beta
- 50 users from waitlist
- Instagram/Discord community
- Weekly surveys

### Week 7-8: Public Beta
- Open access with "Beta" label
- Feedback widget in chat
- Public roadmap

## Success Criteria for Full Build

Before investing in full implementation:
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] 40% week-over-week retention
- [ ] 4.5+ star rating
- [ ] Clear monetization path
- [ ] Platform approval for scaling

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Today:** Set up Meta Developer account
2. **Tomorrow:** Deploy basic webhook endpoint
3. **This Week:** Ship Week 1 prototype
4. **Next Week:** Get first 10 users testing
