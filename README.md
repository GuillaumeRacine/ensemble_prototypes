## 🚀 Getting Started

### Core Assumptions to Validate
1. **Hybrid Intelligence > Pure Search** - Recommendation engine beats Amazon/Google Shopping
2. **Memory Creates Compounding Value** - System improves measurably with each interaction
3. **Conversational UI Unlocks Sharing** - Users share 3x more context via chat than forms
4. **Fast + Learning = Retention** - <2 min satisfaction with >40% 7-day return rate

### MVP Implementation Approach
1. **Week 1-2**: Foundation infrastructure and conversation engine
2. **Week 3-4**: AI integration and hybrid recommendation system  
3. **Week 5-6**: Multi-database intelligence layer
4. **Week 7-8**: Advanced features and production readiness

### Success Criteria
- **Product-Market Fit**: NPS >50, >70% find recommendations better than alternatives
- **Unit Economics**: CAC/LTV <0.3, <$2 AI cost per recommendation
- **Network Effects**: Measurable improvement with user base growth
- **Technical Performance**: <500ms total pipeline, >85% relevance rate

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### 5-Database Hybrid System
```
Core Data Intelligence Layer
├── PostgreSQL (Users, sessions, transactions, outcomes)
├── Neo4j (Relationship graph, social patterns, influence networks)  
├── Vector DB (Semantic embeddings, cultural intelligence, gift matching)
├── Redis (Real-time state, conversation context, hot recommendations)
└── Event Store (Complete behavioral history, learning patterns)
```

### AI/ML Processing Layer
- **GPT-4.1** for conversation and reasoning (1M context window)
- **RAG System** for gift catalog + cultural knowledge base
- **Vector Search** for sub-100ms semantic gift matching
- **Predictive Models** for relationship trajectory and optimal timing

### Multi-Stage Recommendation Pipeline
1. **Candidate Generation**: 1M+ → 1K products (<50ms)
2. **Deep Ranking**: Relationship + occasion + personalization scoring (<300ms)
3. **Final Optimization**: Diversity, business rules, explanations (<50ms)
4. **Total Pipeline**: <500ms end-to-end

## 🧪 Custom Claude Code Commands

Use these commands for product development workflow:

- **`/spec [product concept]`** - Generate comprehensive product brief following Marty Cagan's approach
- **`/tech_research [technical challenge]`** - Conduct deep technical architecture research
- **`/improve_spec_prompt [baseline prompt]`** - Optimize prompts for better Claude Code usage

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Assumption Validation (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on testing core assumptions with minimal viable features. Clear go/no-go decision points based on user behavior data.

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit (Months 2-6)  
Scale validated features, build network effects, establish defensible data moats.

### Phase 3: Market Leadership (Year 1-2)
Enterprise expansion, international markets, advanced AI capabilities.

## 📊 Key Metrics Dashboard

Track these metrics for informed decision-making:
- **Assumption Validation**: Clear pass/fail criteria for each core assumption
- **User Engagement**: Conversation completion, information sharing depth
- **Recommendation Quality**: Relevance scores, purchase intent, satisfaction ratings
- **Business Viability**: CAC/LTV ratios, revenue per user, retention cohorts
- **Technical Performance**: Response times, accuracy rates, system reliability

## 🎯 The Vision

Transform Present Agent from a "gift recommendation app" into the "Relationship Operating System" - the foundational infrastructure for expressing care in human connections.

**10-Year Goal**: Own the complete emotional economy of gift-giving, becoming as essential as LinkedIn for professional networks, but for personal relationships.

**The key insight**: We're not building a gift app. We're building the emotional intelligence layer for human relationships in the digital age.
